                  You probably use CapCut and think your video editing is
                  special. You think your fucking TikTok with 47 transitions and
                  12 different fonts is going to get you some viral fame. You
                  think loading up every goddamn effect in their library makes
                  your content better. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe what
                  CapCut actually gives you:

                  You. Are. Getting. Scammed. Look at this shit. It's a fucking
                  video editor. Why the fuck do you need to pay $20/month just
                  to remove a goddamn watermark? You spent hours editing your
                  video and they slap their logo on it like they fucking made
                  it.

                  This motherfucking dialog pops up more than ads on a pirated
                  movie site. Want to add a transition? Get Pro. Want to export
                  without their watermark? Get Pro. Want to use more than 2
                  fonts? Get fucking Pro, peasant.

                  Did you seriously think you could edit a video without seeing
                  this dialog 47 times? You click one button and BAM - there it
                  is again, asking for your credit card like a desperate ex
                  asking for money.

                  You dumbass. You thought CapCut was free, but no. Free means
                  they let you open the app. Everything else costs money. Basic
                  shake effect? That'll be $20/month. A decent transition that
                  isn't "fade"? Pay up, motherfucker.

                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  Here's my favorite piece of bullshit: You import an MP3 file -
                  you know, AUDIO - and try to export. "Sorry, can't export
                  because you're using our premium extract audio feature!"

                  <strong>
                    My MP3 was already fucking audio, you absolute morons.

                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  But wait, there's more! If you drag that same MP3 to their
                  media panel first, then to the timeline, it magically works.
                  This isn't a bug, it's a fucking scam disguised as software
                  engineering.

                  sues anyone, that's your problem."

                  Here's the thing that makes me want to punch my monitor: the
                  actual video editor is fucking good. It's intuitive, powerful,
                  and anyone can figure it out. When it's not begging for money
                  every 30 seconds, it actually works well.

                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  Which makes everything else so much worse. They built
                  something people want to use, then turned it into a digital

                  Like the person who's never used software that doesn't

                  A real video editor lets you edit videos. It doesn't steal

                  I'm not actually saying all video editors should be basic as
                  shit. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with
                  video editing apps are{" "}
                  <strong>ones they create themselves</strong>. Video editors
                  aren't broken by default - they edit videos, export them, and
                  let you use basic features without constantly begging for
                  money. CapCut breaks them. They turn them into payment
                  processors with video editing as a side feature.
